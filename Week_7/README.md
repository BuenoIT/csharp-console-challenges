## Challenge #1

Title: Basic Math Quiz

Description: In this challenge, you will create a simple math quiz program that tests the user's knowledge of variables, operators, decision statements, methods, and iteration in C#. The program will generate a series of math questions that the user must answer correctly.

Here are the requirements for the program:

1. The program should generate 10 random math questions, using variables and operators such as +, -, *, and /.

2. Each question should be displayed to the user, along with a prompt to enter their answer.

3. After the user has answered all 10 questions, the program should display their score (i.e. the number of questions they answered correctly out of 10).

4. The program should use decision statements (such as if/else) to determine if the user's answer is correct or not.

5. The program should use methods to generate the random math questions and to check the user's answers.

6. The program should use iteration (such as a for loop) to generate and display the 10 math questions.
