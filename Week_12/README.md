# Week 12

Classes and Objects

## Concepts

- What is a class in C#?
A class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects that define the properties, methods, and events of the objects.

- What is an object in C#?
An object in C# is an instance of a class that contains data and behavior defined by the class.

- How are classes and objects related in C#?
A class is a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. You use classes to define the properties and methods of objects, and then you create objects based on those classes.

- What is encapsulation in C#?
Encapsulation in C# is the practice of hiding the implementation details of a class from other parts of the program and providing a public interface for interacting with the object.

- What is inheritance in C#?
Inheritance in C# is the ability to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties, methods, and events.

- What is polymorphism in C#?
Polymorphism in C# is the ability to use a single interface to represent multiple types of objects, allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.

- What is the difference between private and public in C#?
Private and public are access modifiers used in C# to specify the level of access to class members. Private members are only accessible within the class where they are declared, while public members can be accessed from outside the class.

## Challenge #1

Title: Password Generator

Description: In this challenge, you will create a console application that generates a random password using a PasswordGenerator class and asks the user to enter the password. The application will then validate whether the entered password matches the generated password using the IsPasswordValid method of the PasswordGenerator class. The user will be prompted with a success message if the password is correct, and a failure message if the password is incorrect. The application will continue to prompt the user for the password until the correct password is entered.


## Challenge #2

Title: User Age Verification

Description: Create a console application that asks the user to enter their name and age. If the user is 18 years or older, the application should welcome them with a message that includes their name and age. If the user is under 18, the application should inform them that they are too young and ask for their parent's permission. The application should continue to ask for the user's age until they are 18 or older."
