# Week 2

A flowchart is a visual representation of a process or algorithm using various symbols, shapes, and arrows to show the flow of data or actions. It is a type of diagram that is commonly used in software development, engineering, business, and other fields to help illustrate complex systems or processes in a clear and concise manner.


## Concepts

### What are the common symbols used in flowcharts and what do they represent?

- Start/End symbol: This symbol represents the beginning and end of a process or flowchart.

- Process symbol: This symbol represents a process or action that is performed as part of the flowchart.

- Input/Output symbol: This symbol represents input or output of data or information in a process.

- Decision symbol: This symbol represents a decision point in the flowchart, where the process can follow one of two or more paths, depending on the outcome of a decision.

- Connector symbol: This symbol is used to connect different parts of a flowchart that are on different pages or sheets.

- Flow line or Arrow: This symbol represents the flow of data or actions between different parts of the flowchart.

- Predefined process symbol: This symbol represents a process or action that is defined elsewhere in the flowchart.

- Off-page connector symbol: This symbol represents a connection to another page or sheet in the flowchart.

- Delay symbol: This symbol represents a delay or pause in the process.

- Terminator symbol: This symbol represents a forced termination of the process or flowchart.

### What software or tool is recommended for creating flowcharts?

- Microsoft Visio: A widely used diagramming and flowcharting tool that offers a range of features and functionalities for creating professional-looking flowcharts.

- Lucidchart: A web-based diagramming and flowcharting tool that offers collaborative features and integration with other productivity tools.

- SmartDraw: A diagramming and flowcharting tool that offers a range of templates and drag-and-drop functionality for creating flowcharts easily.

- Draw.io: An open-source diagramming and flowcharting tool that can be used offline or online, and offers a range of integrations and customization options.

- Gliffy: A web-based diagramming and flowcharting tool that offers a range of templates and shapes for creating flowcharts quickly.

## Challenge #1

### Title: 
Create a flowchart and implement a C# program that reads the length and width of a rectangle and calculates its area.

### Description:
Create a program that reads the length and width of a rectangle and calculates its area using C#. To complete this challenge, you need to design a flowchart that describes the logical steps required to calculate the area of a rectangle. Once you have a flowchart, you will need to translate it into C# code that prompts the user to input the length and width of the rectangle and outputs the calculated area. This challenge will test your ability to design an algorithm using flowchart symbols and then implement it in a programming language like C#.
