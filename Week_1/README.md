# Week 1

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. C# is designed to be simple, powerful, and versatile, with features that make it well-suited for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop applications to mobile apps to web services.


## Concepts

- What is C#?

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that is designed to run on the .NET Framework. C# is a high-level language that is easy to learn, yet powerful and flexible enough to create a wide range of software applications, from desktop applications to mobile apps to web services.

- What is .NET?

.NET is a software development framework created by Microsoft that provides a set of tools and libraries for developing and running applications on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The .NET Framework includes a common runtime, a set of class libraries, and a compiler that allows developers to write applications in a variety of programming languages, including C#.

- How does C# differ from .NET?

The main difference between C# and .NET is that C# is a programming language while .NET is a software development framework. C# is used to write code and create applications, while .NET provides a runtime environment and libraries that support the execution of C# code, as well as code written in other .NET-supported languages. In other words, C# is a tool for building software, and .NET is a platform that supports the execution of software built with C# and other .NET languages.


## Challenge #1

Title: C# "Hello, World!" Challenge

Description: In this challenge, you will be asked to create a simple "Hello, World!" application in C#. Your application should print the message "Hello, World!" to the console or display it in a window. This challenge is designed to test your knowledge of the C# syntax and basic programming concepts, such as creating a new project, defining a method, and using the Console class to output text.
