# Week 3

Statements, Data Types, Variables, Operators


## Concepts

- What are statements in C#?

Statements in C# are individual instructions that perform a specific action, such as assigning a value to a variable, calling a method, or looping through a set of instructions.

- What are the different data types in C#?

C# supports several data types, including integer, floating-point, Boolean, character, string, and object.

- How do you declare a variable in C#?

To declare a variable in C#, you specify the data type of the variable, followed by the variable name and an optional initial value. For example, to declare an integer variable called "myNumber" with an initial value of 5, you would write "int myNumber = 5;".

- What are operators in C#?

Operators in C# are symbols that perform mathematical or logical operations on one or more operands. Examples of operators in C# include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==), and logical operators (&&, ||).

- What is the difference between the = operator and the == operator in C#?

The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable, while the == operator is used to compare two values for equality. For example, "x = 5;" assigns the value 5 to the variable x, while "if (x == 5)" checks whether the value of x is equal to 5.

## Challenge #1

Title: Calculator Challenge.

Description: Write a C# program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). The program should then perform the corresponding mathematical operation on the two numbers and display the result. Use appropriate data types, variables, and operators to accomplish this task. Make sure to handle possible errors, such as dividing by zero.
